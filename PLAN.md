1. basic skeleton app ✓
2. text bubbles are editable and can be dragged ✓
3. lines between nodes are drawn ✓
4. ~multiple lines per node are possible~
5. research and spike some graph drawing lib
	5. #1 learn viewbox and translating on svg ✓
	5. #2 center graph on screen ✓
	5. #3 render nicer data ✓
	5. #4 try rendering react component via foreign object ✓
6. polish 1
  - cleaner code
  - extract components, reuse between trees ✓
7. UI for controlling tree size and re-render ✓
8. decide upon data structure
9. svg overflow + scrolling for good UX
10. improve styling of content inside node
11. adding new node 

- add backend and data somehow
- consider if dragging nodes makes sense
