1. basic skeleton app ✓
2. text bubbles are editable and can be dragged ✓
3. lines between nodes are drawn ✓
4. ~multiple lines per node are possible~
5. research and spike some graph drawing lib
	5. #1 learn viewbox and translating on svg ✓
	5. #2 center graph on screen ✓
	5. #3 render nicer data ✓
	5. #4 try rendering react component via foreign object ✓
6. polish 1
  - cleaner code
  - extract components, reuse between trees
  - better textarea
7. UI for controlling tree size and re-render
8. adding new bubble
9. consider if dragging makes sense

- add backend and data somehow
